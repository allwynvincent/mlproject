## E2E ML Project


Description:
This repository is a comprehensive guide to building end-to-end machine learning projects for web deployment, designed to help you learn industry-relevant skills and crack data science interviews. It includes step-by-step instructions for setting up the project, organizing code, and implementing best practices like logging, exception handling, and modular coding.

Key Features:

Project Setup: Instructions for creating a GitHub repository, setting up a local environment, and syncing with GitHub.

Package Building: Use of setup.py and requirements.txt for dependency management and Python package creation.

Modular Code Structure: Organized into components (data_ingestion.py, data_transformation.py, model_trainer.py) and pipelines (train_pipeline.py, predict_pipeline.py).

Logging & Exception Handling: Implementation of logger.py and exception.py for robust error tracking and debugging.

Real-World Focus: Emphasis on industry standards, scalability, and maintainability.

Upcoming Features:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

Integration with MongoDB for data ingestion.

Model training, evaluation, and deployment pipelines.
